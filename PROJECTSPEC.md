# Project Specification: Autonomous AI Dependency Management CLI Agent

Version: 0.1 Draft

1. Introduction & Overview

This project aims to design and build a background-running, AI-powered command-line interface (CLI) agent named AutoUpdateAgent. The primary goal is to automate software and dependency management tasks within local development environments by leveraging artificial intelligence models trained on changelog analysis and breaking change detection.

The AutoUpdateAgent will perform continuous or periodic scanning of package repositories and project dependencies, identify potential updates based on release notes (changelogs), analyze the impact of these updates (especially regarding breaking changes), and optionally execute automated updates. It should provide a user-friendly CLI interface for manual control, configuration, and monitoring.

2. Goals

Automated Discovery: Continuously scan project dependencies across various package managers (npm, pip, Maven, Gradle, etc.) to find new releases matching defined criteria.
AI-Driven Impact Analysis: Utilize AI models (e.g., trained on historical changelogs) to predict if an update introduces a breaking change or requires significant code adjustments. This analysis should consider the nature of changes, added features, removed APIs, and dependency updates mentioned in the changelog.
Breaking Change Management: Suggest safe update strategies for packages identified as having potential breaking changes. Offer interactive mode (if required) to guide users through necessary modifications.
Dependency Lag Resolution: Identify and propose updates for dependencies that are significantly outdated relative to their declared version requirements or best practices (AutoUpdateAgent should compare against a database of known versions/potential issues).
Efficient Local Update: Provide robust CLI commands allowing developers to manually trigger, configure, and execute software/dependency upgrades locally with minimal friction.
Background Operation: Run silently in the background (e.g., as a long-running process or service) performing scans based on user-defined schedules or thresholds. Should be able to operate independently but safely without interfering with normal development work unless interacting via CLI.
Safety & Security: Implement checks to avoid updating known malicious packages and suggest updates that introduce security vulnerabilities only if other criteria (e.g., severity, impact) are met.
3. Non-Goals

Fully autonomous execution of all updates in the background without any user confirmation or logging for problematic changes.
Requires human oversight for critical breaking change scenarios.
Managing dependencies entirely outside a project's context/requirements file (though it will be based on them).
Replacing standard package managers (npm, pip, etc.) commands completely. It should integrate with existing tools.
AI model training and fine-tuning are out of scope for this initial spec, but the system must be designed to incorporate such models later.
4. Scope

4.1 Core Engine

*   Functionality to monitor configured projects (tracking their package manager type, project directory, requirement file).
*   Mechanism to periodically or continuously scan package repositories for updates of tracked dependencies.
*   Database to store:
    *   Project configurations (paths, requirements files, allowed update types).
    *   Current state of dependency updates (`AutoUpdateAgent` should track which packages are outdated and the reason).
    *   AI model predictions (timestamps, version pairs, confidence scores for breaking changes).
    *   Logs of all scans, analyses, actions taken.
*   Logic to filter scan results based on project configuration (e.g., only warn about critical security updates if `--autocorrect` is not enabled).
4.2 CLI Interface

*   Set of commands (`update`, `check`, `status`, `configure`, etc.) for user interaction.
*   Flags and subcommands to control the level of automation (e.g., suggest, preview, apply).
*   Command to specify project context or configuration file.
4.3 AI Module

*   Integration points with one or more trained ML models for changelog analysis.
    *   Model A: Classifies a changelog entry as indicative of a release vs. general development notes (or uses version bumps).
    *   Model B: Predicts the likelihood of a breaking change in an update based on its changelog and previous versions' diffs/API changes.
*   Input/output interface for these models.
4.4 Continuous Integration Features

*   Option to suggest building and running tests after potential updates (requires CI/CD system access, e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
*   Logic to potentially revert an update if a subsequent scan detects failures or breaking changes confirmed by the user.
*   Ability for users during interactive mode to specify integration testing steps.
5. User Stories

As a Developer:

I want AutoUpdateAgent to run automatically in the background so that my dependencies stay updated without manual effort, reducing potential vulnerabilities and compatibility issues.
When running manually (check command), I want it to scan all configured projects for available updates based on their changelogs, prioritizing security patches and critical bug fixes.
If AutoUpdateAgent detects a high-risk breaking change update during manual check, I want the ability to interactively review the proposed code changes before applying them.
As an Administrator:

I want to configure AutoUpdateAgent so it knows which projects to monitor and their specific dependency update preferences (e.g., only allow security updates without breaking change flags).
When running AutoUpdateAgent, I want the ability to view detailed status reports, including outdated dependencies and AI-predicted risks.
As a Security Lead:

I want AutoUpdateAgent's background operation to consider packages with known security vulnerabilities as critical updates.
During manual checks (check command), I want it to flag potential updates that might introduce new security issues (based on vulnerability databases).
6. Features

6.1 Continuous Background Scanning

The agent runs persistently in the background after startup or system boot.
It periodically polls configured package repositories and project local directories for changes.
6.2 Periodic Triggered Updates Check

Allows scheduling updates checks via CLI (e.g., auto-update check --schedule-daily).
Checks can be triggered manually without continuous background operation.
6.3 Release Detection from Changelogs/Web Pages

Monitors project repositories for new releases.
Parses changelog files (README, CHANGELOG.md, docs/releases) to determine if the release is desirable (i.e., not a pre-release like alpha/beta/rc).
Analyzes commit messages or release notes on web pages (if available) linked from tags/releases.
6.4 Dependency Lag Resolution

Compares installed dependency versions against those specified in requirement files (package.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml etc.) and the latest known version.
Flags dependencies that are significantly outdated or behind best practices.
6.5 AI Model Integration for Breaking Change Prediction

Triggers an API call to one or more ML models when a potentially breaking change update is found (based on release notes).
Output includes prediction score (e.g., low, medium, high risk of breaking) and confidence level.
6.6 Interactive Mode for Breaking Change Handling

If an AI model flags high-confidence breaking changes, the user can initiate interactive mode via CLI (auto-update interact --project my_project).
Guides user through potential code changes (e.g., sed, patch scripts), showing diffs and allowing confirmation or rejection.
6.7 Automated Code Change Introduction (Conditional)

Based on user configuration:
Applies updates automatically if the AI model predicts low risk.
Shows previews of required changes for medium-risk scenarios, requiring explicit approval (auto-update apply --project my_project).
For high-risk breaking changes, only allows preview or manual execution outside interactive mode (or requires even higher confirmation threshold).
6.8 Local Package Manager Integration

Ability to run commands like npm update, pip install -U, etc., for the detected updates when prompted by the CLI.
6.9 Configuration Management

Stores project configurations and user preferences in a database or config file (~/.auto-update/config.toml).
6.10 Status Reporting

Provides verbose output via CLI commands (status) showing outdated dependencies, AI predictions, recommended actions.
Logs activities to a local log file for review.
7. Architecture & Components

CLI Interface: auto-update, A subcommand structure (e.g., update check, update apply, configure, status).
Core Engine:
ProjectMonitor: Tracks project directories and their dependencies.
RepositoryScanner: Handles interaction with package registries (npmjs.com, PyPI, Maven Central) via APIs or web scraping. Needs to handle different auth methods (public vs. private repos like GitHub Packages).
FileParser: Parses requirement files and changelog formats.
UpdateQueue: Manages the list of potential updates detected by scanning (AutoUpdateAgent should prioritize them based on severity, type, etc.). This queue is stored in a database or memory store (consider persistence).
AI Module: A separate service or library providing endpoints for:
Model prediction API.
Training data ingestion pipeline (future-proofing).
Dependency Management Logic: Decides which updates to apply based on config, AI predictions, and user interaction. Coordinates calls to package manager wrappers.
8. Technical Details

8.1 Input/Output

Input:
Project configuration file (auto-update.yaml or .auto-updateignore, package.json, etc.).
Example content (minimal): specifies project root, requirement file path.
Configuration might include:
List of projects to monitor (by directory or config file name).
User preferences for update automation levels (e.g., automatically_correct_critical_breaking = true).
Package manager credentials if needed.
Output:
CLI commands provide clear feedback on actions taken.
Status reports show version numbers, predicted breaking status, required code changes.
8.2 Dependencies

Go or Rust (for performance and reliability). Python could be used for parts interacting with package managers that have mature Python bindings, but core might benefit from compiled languages.
Libraries:
github.com/gitlab.com API client libraries.
Web scraping libraries (net/http, colly) or dedicated tools (Scrapy).
Package manager command-line client wrappers (e.g., gogetdoc/godoc style for parsing docs, specific clients like dep or gomodule for Go; Python has pip itself and libraries to parse PyPI JSON). Need abstraction.
Diff comparison library (diff, git diff command usage).
AI Model: Placeholder for model integration. Could start with a keyword-based heuristic (e.g., if "BREAKING CHANGE" is mentioned, flag it) before replacing with ML models.
8.3 Monitoring & Scheduling

Use Go's time ticker or cron-like scheduling.
Consider Docker containerization to easily manage and restart the background agent (AutoUpdateAgent should be resilient enough to handle restarts without data loss).
9. User Interaction

The CLI tool will provide standard output (non-interactive mode).
For potentially dangerous updates (high breaking change score), a flag --auto might not apply, requiring the user to use interactive commands or configure AutoUpdateAgent to act automatically.
If UI interaction is required (as per spec prompt: "If it requires UI interaction..."), clarify how this would happen. Options include:
Using standard terminal input/output for simple menus/confirmations (auto-update interact --project my_project).
Leveraging system-native tools like dialog, whiptail, or even GUI desktop notifications if the OS allows.
The agent itself should not have a persistent UI; interaction is on-demand via CLI.
10. Logging & Alerts

Log background activities (scans, updates attempted) with timestamps and levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR).
Provide verbose output for foreground operations (check, status).
Consider sending alerts (e.g., email, Slack message) only in case of critical errors or urgent security updates if configured.
11. Security

Secure Updates: Only update dependencies found via official API scans.
Integrity Checks: Verify downloaded packages using checksums (npm-shasum, PyPI metadata sha256).
Whitelist/Blacklist: Allow users to specify trusted package sources and blocklists for specific packages or versions (e.g., --ignore-package flag). This could prevent updating malicious libraries even if found in a public repo.
Secure Configuration: Store sensitive information (like private registry credentials) securely, potentially using OS keychains or environment variables.
12. Performance

Minimize the overhead during scanning and analysis phases to allow smooth background operation.
Optimize database queries for status retrieval.
Implement caching where appropriate (e.g., store known changelog structures).
13. Future Considerations

Integration with CI/CD pipelines (automatically run tests, deploy if successful).
Advanced AI analysis: predicting impact on specific codebases or projects beyond general breaking change detection.
GUI dashboard for overview and detailed interaction.
