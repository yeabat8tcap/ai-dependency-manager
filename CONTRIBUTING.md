# Contributing to AI Dependency Manager

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the AI Dependency Manager as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Code Style

* Follow the [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
* Use `gofmt` to format your code
* Run `golangci-lint` to check for issues
* Write meaningful commit messages using [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/)

### Testing

* Write unit tests for new functionality
* Add integration tests for complex features
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
* Maintain or improve code coverage

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/8tcapital/ai-dep-manager/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/8tcapital/ai-dep-manager/issues/new).

### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please use the [feature request template](https://github.com/8tcapital/ai-dep-manager/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) when submitting new ideas.
